# AI Planet Deep Learning Project
## Project as part of Deep Learning bootcamp

As part of the [Deep Learning](https://aiplanet.com/bootcamp/certificate/verify/b7d1b598-0afc-4963-b7fe-03f14c39bc7a) bootcamp by AI Planet formerly DPhi and IIT Bombay Data Analytics around July, I had to work on a project where I used VGG19 layer to train a neural network model that classified an image of a weather as sunny, rainy, foggy, cloudy or sunrise.

**Description:** Developed a weather image classification model using VGG19 architecture and Keras, enabling accurate categorization of weather-related images.  
**Achievements:** 
- Utilized VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for effective feature extraction.
- Implemented the model using Keras for flexibility and ease of use.
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying weather images, contributing to improved image analysis capabilities.
